## Abstract and Figures
As technology advances, artificial intelligence (AI) may play a larger role in building design and construction. 
AI-powered technologies could manage and control building functions such as heating and cooling, lighting, and security. 
These devices could use historical data to improve building performance and cut energy use.

Algorithms built on machine learning are capable of data analysis, pattern recognition, and prediction. 
On the other hand, it is now possible to produce visuals from provided text thanks to the advancement of AI algorithms. 
The technique of generating an image from text is known as text-to-image generation. 
Since the images that are produced are frequently very realistic, this method can be used to provide a wide variety of visual content. 
The text-to-image generating technique is projected to become a more crucial tool in the field of architecture as AI technology develops. 
It could be used to build interactive, immersive experiences for users to explore many design alternatives as the algorithms shift from 2D to 3D generation.

Through text-to-image generation, AI is transforming the way we visualize ideas. 
AI-powered tools like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney have paved the way for a plethora of aesthetic masterpieces. 
These tools will be tested in the field by architects and designers for use in conceptual design. 
AI allows designers to investigate a broader range of design concepts from a fresh perspective. 
These technologies increase the chance of serendipity, hence broadening the range of creative capabilities beyond traditional methods. 
They make it easier to manipulate data and come up with creative solutions to creative problems.
